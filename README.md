#Data and script repository for generating figures 3 and 9 in publication.
#Article is "Gene Expression Changes in Response to Field-to-Lab Transition in the Argentine Ant, Linepithema humile.", currently being considered for publication in Insect Physiology.

Figure 3:
"Dittmann et al. 2019 - Scatterplot Code" is R script used to generate scatterplot. These datasheets are used in script to generate plot:
Volcano Plot - EdgeR Data.csv
Volcano Plot - Cuffdiff Data.csv
Volcano Plot - DESeq2 Data.csv
Differential_Expression Any2 Loci.csv

Figure 9:
"Dittmann et al. 2019 - Regression Meta Analysis Code" is R script used to generate regression meta-analysis plot.  "Fold Change Full.csv" datasheet is used to generate plot.  Plot readability was improved in MS paint.
